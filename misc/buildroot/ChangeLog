buildroot-0.1.0 2007-03-09 <spudmonkey@racsa.co.cr>

	Support for arm-elf toolchain

buildroot-0.1.1 (revision number not used)

buildroot-0.1.2 2008-11-06 <spudmonkey@racsa.co.cr>

	* Add support for m68k-elf and m68hc11 toolchain
	* Add patch to build older binutils with newer Texinfo version
	* Add support for SH-1 toolchain

buildroot-0.1.3 2009-02-28 <spudmonkey@racsa.co.cr>

	* Add support for H8/300 toolchain
	* Add support for GCC 4.2.4 and binutils 2.19
	* Various fixes for newer Linux environments
	* New ARM configuration using GCC 4.2.4 and binutils 2.19
	* Add Renesas R8C/M16C/M32C configuration using GCC 4.2.4 and binutils 2.19

buildroot-0.1.4 2009-04-19 <spudmonkey@racsa.co.cr>

	* Add support for a blackfin toolchain using GCC 4.2.4 and binutils 2.19
	* GCC 4.2.4 no longer attempts to build libstdc++.  Now we can build g++!
	* The ARM GCC-4.2.4 configuration was changed so that it now builds g++.
	* Removed building of initial and final GCC.  that is not necessary because
	  we do not build a libc.  Now it builds almost twice as fast.
	* Removed logic to build the target GCC.  That is never used.

buildroot-0.1.5 2009-04-25 <spudmonkey@racsa.co.cr>

	* Replaced config/arm-defconfig-4.2.4 with config/arm920t-defconfig-4.2.4
	  and config/arm926t-defconfig-4.2.4 because of differences in the
	  way that soft floating point is handled between these two
	  architectures.
	* Add support for gcc-4.3.3 and the ARM Cortex-M3 processor (thumb2)
	* Add support for binutils 2.19.1

buildroot-0.1.6 2009-05-19 <spudmonkey@racsa.co.cr>

	* Added config/arm7tdmi-defconfig-4.2.4
	* Added config/arm920t-defconfig-4.3.3
	* Correct error in arm-defconfig gcc-3.4.6 build. The gcc-3.4.6 configuration
	  does not not take --with-abi
	* Correct error in gcc-3.4.6/gcc/collect.c.  Calls open with O_CREAT but
	  does not specify mode.  Newer host compilers can error out on this.

buildroot-0.1.7 2009-06-26 <spudmonkey@racsa.co.cr>

	* configs/avr-defconfig-4.3.3: Added support for AVR to support a NuttX
	  port of the ATmega128.
	* toolchain/nxflat:  Added logic to build NuttX NXFLAT binding support tools
	* toolchain/genromfs:  Added support for the genromfs tool

buildroot-1.8 2009-12-21 <spudmonkey@racsa.co.cr>

	* configs/cortexm3-defconfig-4.3.3: Added support for NuttX NXFLAT
	  tools.
	* configs/arm7tdmi-defconfig-4.3.3: Update to arm7tdmi-defconfig-4.2.4.
	  Also builds NuttX NXFLAT tools.
	* configs/m68hc12-defconfig-4.3.3: Update to m68ch11-defconfig.
	* configs/m68hc12-defconfig-3.4.6: There are problems building GCC
	  4.3.3 for the hc12.
	* configs/m32c-defconfig-4.2.4: Added genromfs
	* configs/m32c-defconfig-4.3.3: Update to m32c-defconfig-4.2.4

buildroot-1.9 2011-02-10 <spudmonkey@racsa.co.cr>

	* configs/arm926t-defconfig-4.3.3: update arm926t-defconfig-4.2.4
	* configs/arm926t-defconfig-nxflat: NXFLAT-only configuration for
	  arm926
	* toolchain/gdb/gdb.mk - Remove ncurses dependency from gdb_target target.
	* toolchain/gdb/gdb.mk - Added --disable-werror to GDB configuration line.
	  GDB 6.8 won't build because the tarbal was released with -Werror enabled and
	  the build stops on the first warning.
	* Add support for Freescale m9s12x using binutils 2.18 and gcc 3.3.6 and
	  patches available from http://www.msextra.com/tools courtesy of James
	  Cortina.  Add configs/m9x12x-defconfig-3.3.6.

buildroot-1.10 2011-xx-xx <spudmonkey@racsa.co.cr>

	* Add patch submitted by Dimiter Georgiev to work around problems in building
	  GDB 6.8 with versions of Cygwin > 1.7.
	* configs/i486-defconfig-4.3.3 - Builds an i486 cross development toolchain
	  using gcc 4.3.3.  Why wouldyou want such a thing?  On Linux, of course,
	  such a thing is not needed because you can use the installed GCC to build
	  i486 ELF binaries.  But that will not work under Cygwin!  The Cygwin
	  toolchain (and probably MinGW), build DOS MZ format executables (i.e.,
	  .exe files).  That is probably not usable for most NuttX targets.
	  Instead, you should use this i486-elf-gcc to generate true ELF binaries
	  under Cygwin.
	* Makefile - Alter copy arguements to avoid permissions problems when
	  copying NuttX header files.
