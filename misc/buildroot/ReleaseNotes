ReleaseNotes v0.1.1:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a highly hacked up version of the buildroot (see
http://buildroot.uclibc.org/ . It has been hacked so
that it can be used to build the following NuttX-compatible
toolchains:

o arm-elf toolchain needed for use with the TI C5471 (ARM7),
  NXP LPC214x (ARM7), STMicro STR71x (ARM7), and TI DM320
  (ARM9) ports provided with the NuttX releases.

o m68k-elf toolchain (not currently used in any NuttX
  configuration).

o m68hc11-elf toolchain (not currently used in any NuttX
  configuration).

o sh-elf toolchain needed for the SH-1 Nuttx port.

This is NOT a part of the NuttX project and is provided only
for convenience. This package is licensed as GPL (see
http://buildroot.uclibc.org/about.html).
