nuttx-0.3.0
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the 12th release of NuttX.  This release includes the initial
integration of a network subsystem and the uIP TCP/IP stack into NuttX
(see http://www.sics.se/~adam/uip/index.php/Main_Page).  Also included
is a device driver for the Davicom DM90x0 ethernet controller.

This integration is very preliminary.  Only a small portion of the
network functionality has been integrated and there are a number of
open issues (see the TODO file).  The network subsystem is pre-alpha
at this point in time.  I expect that it will stabilize and mature
over the next few releases.

The baseline functionality of NuttX continues to mature and remains at
post-beta (as long as the network is not used).

See the ChangeLog for a complete list of changes.

This release has been verified only on the Neuros OSD (DM320 ARM9)
platform using the DM90x0 driver.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from November 6, 2007.

nuttx-0.3.1
^^^^^^^^^^^

the integration of a network subsystem and the uIP TCP/IP, UDP, and
ICMP stacks into NuttX (see http://www.sics.se/~adam/uip/index.php/Main_Page).

Many network-related problems have been fixed and the implementation
has matured significantly.  However, the level of network reliability
is probably still at the pre-alpha or early level.  It is sufficiently
complete that you may begin to perform some network integration and
is exepcted to achieve beta level of reliability over the next few
releases.

The baseline functionality of NuttX continues to mature and remains at
post-beta (as long as the network is not used).

See the ChangeLog for a complete list of changes.

nuttx-0.3.6
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the 18th release of NuttX.  This release contains on a few
changes.  The primary purpose of this release is to synchronize with
the release of the pascal-0.1.0 add-on package.

This release of NuttX includes the following changes:

* Fixes for use with SDCC compiler
* Added a simulated z80 target (arch/z80)
* Fix deadlock errors when using stdio but with no buffering
* Add support for the add-on Pascal P-Code interpreter (pcode/)
  (see the pascal-0.1.0 package)

This release were verified only on the simulated Z80 and and host
simulation targets.  As usual, any feedback about bugs or suggestions
for improvement would be greatly appreciated.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from January 6, 2007.

====

There was an error in the initial 0.3.6 release that prevented
a successful build unless the Pascal add-on was present.  The
tarball was patched to include the fix.  Make sure that you download
the nuttx-0.3.6.1.tar.gz version to avoid this problem.

nuttx-0.3.7
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the 19th release of NuttX.  This release includes the
preliminary port of NuttX to the ZiLOG z16f 16-bit microcontroller.
This port was verified using the ZiLOG z16f2800100zcog Development
and the ZiLOG ZDS-II toolchain. See http://www.zilog.com for
further information.

I emphasize that this is a preliminary release of the z16f port and
is only alpha or, perhaps, pre-alpha quality as of this writing.
There are a list of known issues in the TODO file in the root of
the NuttX directory.  The overall quality of NuttX (excluding the
z16f port) continues to improve beyond the late beta level.

The z16f port required numerous changes to NuttX to handle:

* NEAR and FAR addressing, and
* Use of a Windows native toolchain in a Cygwin build environment.

In addition to the z16f port, at least one very critical bug was
found and corrected in NuttX:  The thread-specific errno value of one
task was being randomly trashed when a different thread exitted.

This release were verified on the ZiLOG z16f2800100zcog, Neuros OSD
(ARM9), and the simulation platforms.  As usual, any feedback about bugs
or suggestions for improvement would be greatly appreciated.

    random access to large files.

  Network:
  * Corrected a critical bug that may prevent recvfrom from receiving packets from
    most remote UDP port numbers.
  * Corrected an error in multi-threaded socket handling in send() and sendto().
    Outgoing data could overwrite incoming data.
  * Corrected IP checksum calculation in ICMP and UDP message send logic.
  * Corrected an error in send() timeout logic.

New features were also added:

  Network:
  * Added support for application access to ICMP protocol stacks; Added
    ping request logic (net/uip).
  * Added basic TFTP client logic (netutils/tftpc).

  NuttShell (NSH):
  * New commands: 'test', '[', 'ping', 'mkrd', 'xd', andTFTP 'get' and 'put'
    commands (See the new NuttShell User Guide for additional information).

Other less critical bugs were also fixed and other less important features were
were added (See the ChangeLog for details).

These changes were verified only on the Neuros OSD (ARM9).  Please report any errors to me.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from September 8, 2008.

nutt-0.3.15
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the 27th release of NuttX.  This release includes some new features:

  * Adds support for the ROMFS filesystem
  * ROMFS supports mmap() to provide eXecute In Place (XIP) capability
  * NuttShell (NSH) can be configured to use ROMFS to provide a tiny read-only
    filesystem with a startup script in /etc.
  * Completed the basic port of the NXP LPC2148 on the mcu123.com board.
    The basic port includes successful booting, timer interrupts, serial console,
    succesfully passing the examples/ostest, and a NuttShell (NSH) configuration.

These changes were verified only on the mcu123.com NXP LPC2148 board.  Please report
any errors to me.

This tarball contains a complete CVS snapshot from September 20, 2008.

nutt-0.3.16
^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the 28th release of NuttX.  This release includes the first support for
USB in NuttX.  A set of USB APIs were added to support USB device controller
drivers and bindings to USB device class drivers.  The form of the interface
was inspired by the Linux Gadget APIs.

At present USB device controller drivers are included for:

  * The NXP LPC214x.  This driver has been verified and is an early alpha
    stage in quality.
  * TI DM320.  Coding for this driver is complete but it is completely untested
    as of this release.

A controller-independent class driver is also included for:

  * USB serial class device driver (emulates the Prolific PL2303 serial-to-USB
    adaptor).  This drver has only been verified with the Linux host PL2303
    driver.

Other new features include:

  * Add an option to set aside a separate stack for interrupt handling (ARM only).
    This is useful when memory is constrained, there are multiple tasks, and
    the interrupt stack requirement is high (as when USB is enabled).

A few bugs were also fixed:

  * Fixed the frequency of system timer interrupts in the NXP LPC214x port
    (off by 20x in nuttx-0.3.15)
  * Fixed serial driver bugs related to (1) open counts and (2) recognizing
    O_NONBLOCK on read.
  * Fixed an error in read(); it was not setting the errno on errors returned
    from the driver.

These changes were verified only on the mcu123.com NXP LPC2148 board using with
a Linux host.  Please report any errors to me.
