# Most compilers support CFLAG options like '-I<dir>' to add include
# file header paths.  Some (like the Zilog tools), do not.  This script
# makes the select of header file paths compiler independent.

# files).  If a new compiler is used that has some unusual syntax, then
# additional logic needs to be added to this file.
