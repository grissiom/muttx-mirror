/****************************************************************************
 * Function: recvfrom
 *
 * Description:
 *   recvfrom() receives messages from a socket, and may be used to receive
 *   data on a socket whether or not it is connection-oriented.
 *
 *   If from is not NULL, and the underlying protocol provides the source
 *   address, this source address is filled in. The argument fromlen
 *   initialized to the size of the buffer associated with from, and modified
 *   on return to indicate the actual size of the address stored there.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   sockfd   Socket descriptor of socket
 *   buf      Buffer to receive data
 *   len      Length of buffer
 *   flags    Receive flags
 *   from     Address of source
 *   fromlen  The length of the address structure
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   On success, returns the number of characters sent.  On  error,
 *   -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately:
 *
 *   EAGAIN
 *     The socket is marked non-blocking and the receive operation would block,
 *     or a receive timeout had been set and the timeout expired before data
 *     was received.
 *   EBADF
 *     The argument sockfd is an invalid descriptor.
 *   ECONNREFUSED
 *     A remote host refused to allow the network connection (typically because
 *     it is not running the requested service).
 *   EFAULT
 *     The receive buffer pointer(s) point outside the process's address space.
 *   EINTR
 *     The receive was interrupted by delivery of a signal before any data were
 *     available.
 *   EINVAL
 *     Invalid argument passed.
 *   ENOMEM
 *     Could not allocate memory for recvmsg().
 *   ENOTCONN
 *     The socket is associated with a connection-oriented protocol and has
 *     not been connected.
 *   ENOTSOCK
 *     The argument sockfd does not refer to a socket.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *
