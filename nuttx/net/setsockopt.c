 * Function: setsockopt
 *
 * Description:
 *   setsockopt() sets the option specified by the 'option' argument,
 *   at the protocol level specified by the 'level' argument, to the value
 *   pointed to by the 'value' argument for the socket associated with the
 *   file descriptor specified by the 'sockfd' argument.
 *
 *   The 'level' argument specifies the protocol level of the option. To set
 *   options at the socket level, specify the level argument as SOL_SOCKET.
 *
 *   See <sys/socket.h> a complete list of values for the 'option' argument.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   sockfd    Socket descriptor of socket
 *   level     Protocol level to set the option
 *   option    identifies the option to set
 *   value     Points to the argument value
 *   value_len The length of the argument value
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *  0 on success; -1 on failure
 *
 *  EBADF
 *    The 'sockfd' argument is not a valid socket descriptor.
 *  EDOM
 *    The send and receive timeout values are too big to fit into the
 *    timeout fields in the socket structure.
 *  EINVAL
 *    The specified option is invalid at the specified socket 'level' or the
 *    socket has been shut down.
 *  EISCONN
 *    The socket is already connected, and a specified option cannot be set
 *    while the socket is connected.
 *  ENOPROTOOPT
 *    The 'option' is not supported by the protocol.
 *  ENOTSOCK
 *    The 'sockfd' argument does not refer to a socket.
 *  ENOMEM
 *    There was insufficient memory available for the operation to complete.
 *  ENOBUFS
 *    Insufficient resources are available in the system to complete the
 *    call.
 *
 * Assumptions:
