/* uIP device driver functions
 *
 * These functions are used by a network device driver for interacting
 * with uIP.
 *
 * Process an incoming packet.
 *
 * This function should be called when the device driver has received
 * a packet from the network. The packet from the device driver must
 * be present in the uip_buf buffer, and the length of the packet
 * should be placed in the uip_len variable.
 *
 * When the function returns, there may be an outbound packet placed
 * in the uip_buf packet buffer. If so, the uip_len variable is set to
 * the length of the packet. If no packet is to be sent out, the
 * uip_len variable is set to 0.
 *
 * The usual way of calling the function is presented by the source
 * code below.
 *
 *     uip_len = devicedriver_poll();
 *     if(uip_len > 0) {
 *       uip_input();
 *       if(uip_len > 0) {
 *         devicedriver_send();
 *       }
 *     }
 *
 * Note: If you are writing a uIP device driver that needs ARP
 * (Address Resolution Protocol), e.g., when running uIP over
 * Ethernet, you will need to call the uIP ARP code before calling
 * this function:
 *
 *     #define BUF ((struct uip_eth_hdr *)&uip_buf[0])
 *     uip_len = ethernet_devicedrver_poll();
 *     if(uip_len > 0) {
 *       if(BUF->type == HTONS(UIP_ETHTYPE_IP)) {
 *         uip_arp_ipin();
 *         uip_input();
 *         if(uip_len > 0) {
 *           uip_arp_out();
 *           ethernet_devicedriver_send();
 *         }
 *       } else if(BUF->type == HTONS(UIP_ETHTYPE_ARP)) {
 *         uip_arp_arpin();
 *         if(uip_len > 0) {
 *           ethernet_devicedriver_send();
 *         }
 *       }

/* Periodic processing for a connection identified by its number.
 *
 * This function does the necessary periodic processing (timers,
 * polling) for a uIP TCP conneciton, and should be called when the
 * periodic uIP timer goes off. It should be called for every
 * connection, regardless of whether they are open of closed.
 *
 * When the function returns, it may have an outbound packet waiting
 * for service in the uIP packet buffer, and if so the uip_len
 * variable is set to a value larger than zero. The device driver
 * should be called to send out the packet.
 *
 * The ususal way of calling the function is through a for() loop like
 * this:
 *
 *     for(i = 0; i < UIP_CONNS; ++i)
 *       {
 *         uip_tcppoll(i);
 *         if (uip_len > 0)
 *           {
 *             devicedriver_send();
 *           }
 *       }
 *
 * Note: If you are writing a uIP device driver that needs ARP
 * (Address Resolution Protocol), e.g., when running uIP over
 * Ethernet, you will need to call the uip_arp_out() function before
 * calling the device driver:
 *
 *     for(i = 0; i < UIP_CONNS; ++i)
 *       {
 *         uip_tcppoll(i);
 *         if (uip_len > 0)
 *           {
 *             uip_arp_out();
 *             ethernet_devicedriver_send();
 *           }
 *       }
 *
 * conn The number of the connection which is to be periodically polled.
