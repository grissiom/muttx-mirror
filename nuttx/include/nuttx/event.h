 *  \brief Events
 * 
 * Event moudle offer real-time signaling and handling of real-time 
 * events at precision of system resolution clock_t.
 * 
 * Events are based on periodic timers, where each started event starts
 * counting at its relative time = 0, and overflows at given period. 
 * Overflow is signalized by posted event that is handled by the 
 * event_eventhandler() called by each thread or task working with 
 * Events. 
 * 
 * Events may be used inside one thread or task only or between tasks 
 * and threads. An event can also be bind to another event i.e.:
 *  - System Clock may issue a notification about Power Failure
 *  - Other threads may connect to this event and when handled, they may
 *    inquiry for pricise time when this event has happend, using the 
 *    event_gettime()
 * 
 * Or system is about to control a process, and instead of looping and 
 * inquiring for time, system timers offer simple and effective 
 * mechanism to control timed actions:
 *  - First event is about to wait 5 seconds, then it must assert some 
 *    switch, triggering another event after 2 seconds, to check the 
 *    state of the system.
 *  - After 2 seconds new event is triggerred, if it is time criticial
 *    it may check for the overrun time and handle further actions,
 *  - ...
 * 
 * Each event is denoted by a callback function event_callback_t, and 
 * an argument. Posted event with the same callback but different 
 * argument is treated as different event, while the same callback with
 * the same argument replaces previously started event.
