 * Name: CLASS_CREATE
 *
 * Description:
 *   This macro will call the create() method of struct usbhost_registry_s.  The create()
 *   method is a callback into the class implementation.  It is used to (1) create
 *   a new instance of the USB host class state and to (2) bind a USB host driver
 *   "session" to the class instance.  Use of this create() method will support
 *   environments where there may be multiple USB ports and multiple USB devices
 *   simultaneously connected.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   reg - The USB host class registry entry previously obtained from a call to
 *     usbhost_findclass().
 *   drvr - An instance of struct usbhost_driver_s that the class implementation will
 *     "bind" to its state structure and will subsequently use to communicate with
 *     the USB host driver.
 *   id - In the case where the device supports multiple base classes, subclasses, or
 *     protocols, this specifies which to configure for.
 *
 * Returned Values:
 *   On success, this function will return a non-NULL instance of struct
 *   usbhost_class_s that can be used by the USB host driver to communicate with the
 *   USB host class.  NULL is returned on failure; this function will fail only if
 *   the drvr input parameter is NULL or if there are insufficient resources to
 *   create another USB host class instance.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   If this function is called from an interrupt handler, it will be unable to
 *   allocate memory and CONFIG_USBHOST_NPREALLOC should be defined to be a value
 *   greater than zero specify a number of pre-allocated class structures.

 * Name: CLASS_CONFIGDESC
 *
 * Description:
 *   This macro will call the configdesc() method of struct usbhost_class_s.  This
 *   method is a callback into the class implementation.  It is used to provide the
 *   device's configuration descriptor to the class so that the class may initialize
 *   properly
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   class - The USB host class entry previously obtained from a call to create().
 *   configdesc - A pointer to a uint8_t buffer container the configuration descripor.
 *   desclen - The length in bytes of the configuration descriptor.
 *
 * Returned Values:
 *   On success, zero (OK) is returned. On a failure, a negated errno value is

 * Name: CLASS_COMPLETE
 *
 * Description:
 *   This macro will call the complete() method of struct usbhost_class_s.  In the
 *   interface with the USB host drivers, the class will queue USB IN/OUT
 *   transactions.  The enqueuing function will return and the transactions will be
 *   performed asynchrounously.  When the transaction completes, the USB host driver
 *   will call this function in order to inform the class that the transaction has
 *   completed and to provide any response data.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   class - The USB host class entry previously obtained from a call to create().
 *   response - Response data buffer
 *   resplen - Number of bytes of data in the response data buffer.
 *
 * Returned Values:
