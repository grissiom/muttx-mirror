 * Name: pg_miss
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function is called from architecture-specific memory segmentaion
 *   fault handling logic.  This function will perform the following
 *   operations:
 *
 *   1) Sanity checking.
 *      - ASSERT if the currently executing task is the page fill worker
 *        thread.  The page fill worker thread is how the the page fault
 *        is resolved and all logic associated with the page fill worker
 *        must be "locked" and always present in memory.
 *   2) Block the currently executing task.
 *      - Call up_block_task() to block the task at the head of the ready-
 *        to-run list.  This should cause an interrupt level context switch
 *        to the next highest priority task.
 *      - The blocked task will be marked with state TSTATE_WAIT_PAGEFILL
 *        and will be retained in the g_waitingforfill prioritized task
 *        list.
 *   3) Boost the page fill worker thread priority.
 *      - Check the priority of the task at the head of the g_waitingforfill
 *        list.  If the priority of that task is higher than the current
 *        priority of the page fill worker thread, then boost the priority
 *        of the page fill worker thread to that priority.
 *   4) Signal the page fill worker thread.
 *      - Is there a page fill pending?  If not then signal the worker
 *        thread to start working on the queued page fill requests.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   None - The head of the ready-to-run list is assumed to be task that
 *   caused the exception.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   None - Either this function function succeeds or an assertion occurs.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   - It is assumed that this function is called from the level of an
 *     exception handler and that all interrupts are disabled.
 *   - It is assumed that currently executing task (the one at the head of
 *     the ready-to-run list) is the one that cause the fault.  This will
 *     always be true unless the page fault occurred in an interrupt handler.
 *     Interrupt handling logic must always be present and "locked" into
 *     memory.
 *   - The chip-specific page fault exception handler has already verified
 *     that the exception did not occur from interrupt/exception handling
 *     logic.
 *   - As mentioned above, the task causing the page fault must not be the
 *     the page fill worker thread because that is the only way to complete
 *     the page fill.
 *
 * NOTES:
 *   1. One way to accomplish this would be a two pass link phase:
 *      - In the first phase, create a partially linked objected containing
 *        all interrupt/exception handling logic, the page fill worker thread
 *        plus all parts of the IDLE thread (which must always be available
 *        for execution).
 *      - All of the .text and .rodata sections of this partial link should
 *        be collected into a single section.
 *      - The second link would link the partially linked object along with
 *        the remaining object to produce the final binary.  The linker
 *        script should position the "special" section so that it lies
 *        in a reserved, "non-swappable" region.
