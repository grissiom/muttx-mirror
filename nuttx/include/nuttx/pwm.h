/* For the purposes of this driver, a PWM device is any devices and generates
 * periodic outputs of controlled frequency and pulse width.  Such is device
 * might be use, for example, to perform pulse-width modulated output or
 * frequency/pulse-count modulated output (such as might be needed to control
 * a stepper motor.
 *
 * The PWM driver is split into two parts:
 *
 * 1) An "upper half", generic driver that provides the comman PWM interface
 *    to application level code, and
 * 2) An "lower half" platform-specific driver that implements the low-level
 *    timer controls to implement the PWM functionality.

/* The PWM module uses a standard character driver framework.  However, since
 * the PWM driver is a devices control interface and not a data transfer
 * interface, the majority of the functionality is implemented in driver
 * ioctl calls.  The PWM ioctal commands are lised below:
 *
 * PWMIOC_SETCHARACTERISTICS - Set the characteristics of the next pulsed
 *   output.  This command will neither start nor stop the pulsed output.
 *   It will either setup the configuration that will be used when the
 *   output is started; or it will change the characteristics of the pulsed
 *   output on the fly if the timer is already started.
 *
 *   ioctl argument:  A read-only reference to struct pwm_info_s that provides
 *   the characteristics of the pulsed output.
 *
 * PWMIOC_GETCHARACTERISTICS - Get the currently selected characteristics of
 *   the pulsed output (independent of whether the output is start or stopped).
 *
 *   ioctl argument:  A reference to struct pwm_info_s to recevie the
 *   characteristics of the pulsed output.
 *
 * PWMIOC_START - Start the pulsed output.  The PWMIOC_SETCHARACTERISTICS
 *   command must have previously been sent.
 *
 *   ioctl argument:  None
 *
 * PWMIOC_STOP - Stop the pulsed output.
 *
 *   ioctl argument:  None

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: pwm_register
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function binds an instance of a "lower half" timer driver with the
 *   "upper half" PWM device and registers that device so that can be used
 *   by application code.
 *
 *   When this function is called, the "lower half" driver should be in the
 *   reset state (as if the shutdown() method had already been called).
 *
 * Input parameters:
 *   path - The full path to the driver to be registers in the NuttX pseudo-
 *     filesystem.  The recommended convention is to name all PWM drivers
 *     as "/dev/pwm0", "/dev/pwm1", etc.  where the driver path differs only
 *     in the "minor" number at the end of the device name.
 *   dev - A pointer to an instance of lower half timer driver.  This instance
 *     is bound to the PWM driver and must persists as long as the driver
 *     persists.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Zero on success; a negated errno value on failure.
