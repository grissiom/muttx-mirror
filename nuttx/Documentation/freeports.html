If you have a hardware platform that you would like to see NuttX ported to then have I got a deal for you:
I am willing to port NuttX to run on your hardware <b><i>FREE</i></b>.
You would, of course, have to provide all hardware, development tools, and documentation.
The functionality would be limited to basic boot-up, serial console, networking, ...
I would need to retain the hardware throught the support cycle.
Of course, this offer depends the availability of free time to do the port.
If you are interested, contact <a href="http://sourceforge.net/users/patacongo/">patacongo</a> at SourceForge.
