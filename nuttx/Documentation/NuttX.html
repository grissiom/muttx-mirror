      NON-GOALS: (1) It is not a goal to provide the rich level of OS

      Small footprint is more important than features.
      Standard compliance is more important than small footprint.
      (2) There is no MMU-based support for processes.

      NuttX strives to achieve a high degree of standards compliance.
      The primary governing standards are POSIX and ANSI standards.
      Additional standard APIs from Unix and other common RTOS's are
      adopted for functionality not available under these standards
      or for functionality that is not appropriate for the deeply-embedded
      RTOS (such as <code>fork()</code>).

  <b>Look at all those files and features... How can it be a tiny OS?</b>.
  The NuttX feature list (above) is fairly long and if you look at the NuttX

  NuttX.  How can NuttX be a tiny OS with all of that?

    <p>
      The philosophy behind that NuttX is that lots of features are great... <i>BUT</i>
      also that if you don't use those features, then you should not have to pay a penalty
      for the unused features.
      And, with NuttX, you don't!  If you don't use a feature, it will not
      be included in the final executable binary.
      You only have to pay the penalty of increased footprint for the features
      that you actually use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using a variety of technologies, NuttX can scale from the very tiny to
      the moderate-size system.  I have executed NuttX with some simple applications
      in as little as 32Kb <i>total</i> memory (code and data).
      On the other hand, typical, richly featured NuttX builds require more like 64Kb
      (and if all of the features are used, this can push 100Kb).

    <p>
      One may be intimidated by the size NuttX source tree.  There are hundreds of source files!
      How can that be a tiny OS?
      Actually, the large number of files is one of the tricks to keep NuttX small and
      as scalable as possible.
      Most files contain only a single function. 
      Sometimes just one tiny function with only a few lines of code.
      Why?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Static Libraries</b>.
        Because in the NuttX build processed, objects are compiled and saved into
        <i>static libraries</i> (<i>archives</i>).
        Then, when the file executable is linked, only the object files that are needed
        are extracted from the archive and added to the final executable.
        By having many, many tiny source files, you can assure that no code that you do
        not execute is ever included in the link.
        And by having many, tiny source files you have better granularity --
        if you don't use that tiny function of even just a few lines of code, it will
        not be included in the binary.

<tr>
  <td><br></td>
  <td>
    <p>
      As mentioned above, the use of many, tiny source files and linking from static
      libraries keeps the size of NuttX down.
      Other tricks used in NuttX include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
         <b>Configuration Files</b>.
         Before you build NuttX, you must provide a configuration file that specifies
         what features you plan to use and which features you do not.
         This configuration file contains a long list of settings that control
         what is built into NuttX and what is not.
         There are hundreds of such settings
         (see the <a href="NuttxPortingGuide.html#apndxconfigs">NuttX Porting Guide</a>
         for a partial list that excludes platform specific settings).
         These many, many configuration options allow NuttX to be highly tuned to
         meet size requirements.
         The downside to all of these configuration options is that it greatly
         complicates the maintenance of NuttX -- but that is my problem, not yours.
      </li>
      <li>
         <b>Weak Symbols</b>
         The GNU toolchain supports <i>weak</i> symbols and these also help to keep
         the size of NuttX down.
         Weak symbols prevent object files from being drawn into the link even if they
         are accessed from source code.
         Careful use of weak symbols is another trick for keep unused code out of the
         final binary.

<p><b>nuttx-5.1 Release Notes</b>:

<p>
  This 48<sup>th</sup> release of NuttX was made on January 30, 2010 and is available for download from the
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=189573">SourceForge</a> website.
  The change log associated with the release is available <a href="#currentrelease">here</a>.
  Unreleased changes after this release are available in CVS.
  These unreleased changes are listed <a href="#pendingchanges">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
  This release adds support for two new MCU architectures in various states of development:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.atmel.com/products/at91/sam3landing.asp?family_id=605">AT91SAM3U</a>
    <p>
      This release adds support for the SAM3U-EK development board with the
      <a href="http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card_mcu.asp?part_id=4562">AT91SAM3U4E</a>.
      As with most NuttX architecutre releases, the release will be rolled out in
      two parts:  A basic port and an extended port.
    </p>
    <p>
      NuttX-5.1 includes the basic port for the SAM3U-EK board.  This release
       passes the NuttX OS test and is proven to have a valid OS implementation.
      It supports the basic boot-up, serial console and timer interrupts.  A
      configuration to support the NuttShell is also included.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extended port will also include support for SDIO-based SD cards and
      USB device (and possible LCD support).  These extensions may or may not
      happen by the Nuttx 5.2 release as my plate is kind of full now.

      The is the most natural development environment for NuttX.
      Any version of the GCC/binutils toolchain may be used.
      There is a  highly modified <a href="http://buildroot.uclibc.org/">buildroot</a>
      available for download from the
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=189573">NuttX SourceForge</a>
      page.
      This download may be used to build a NuttX-compatible ELF toolchain under Linux or Cygwin.
      That toolchain will support ARM, m68k, m68hc11, m68hc12, and SuperH ports.

      Also very usable is the Linux environment using the

      The SDCC compiler provides support for the 8051/2, z80, hc08, and other microcontrollers.
      The SDCC-based logic is less well exercised and you will likely find some compilation
      issues if you use parts of NuttX with SDCC that have not been well-tested.

  </td>

<tr>

    <p>
      This is a tougher environment.
      In this case, the Windows native toolchain is unaware of the
      Cygwin <i>sandbox</i> and, instead, operates in the native Windows environment.
      The primary difficulties with this are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Paths</b>.
        Full paths for the native toolchain must follow Windows standards.
        For example, the path <code>/home/my\ name/nuttx/include</code> my have to be
        converted to something like <code>'C:\cygwin\home\my name\nuttx\include'</code>
        to be usable by the toolchain.
      </li>
      <p>
        Fortunately, this conversion is done simply using the <code>cygpath</code> utility.
      </p>
      <li>
        <b>Symbolic Links</b>
        NuttX depends on symbolic links to install platform-specific directories in the build system.
        On Linux, true symbolic links are used.
        On Cygwin, emulated symbolic links are used.
        Unfortunately, for native Windows applications that operate outside of the
        Cygwin <i>sandbox</i>, these symbolic links cannot be used.
      </li>
      <p>
        The NuttX make system works around this limitation by copying the platform
        specific directories in place.
        These copied directories make work a little more complex, but otherwise work well.
      </p>
      <li>
        <b>Dependencies</b>
        NuttX uses the GCC compiler's <code>-M</code> option to generate make dependencies.  These
        dependencies are retained in files called <code>Make.deps</code> throughout the system.
        For compilers other than GCC, there is no support for making dependencies in this way.
        For Windows native GCC compilers, the generated dependencies are windows paths and not
        directly usable in the Cygwin make.  By default, dependencies are surpressed for these
        compilers as well.
      </li>
      <p><small>
        NOTE: dependencies are suppress by setting the make variable <code>MKDEPS</code> to point
        to the do-nothing dependency script, <code>tools/mknulldeps.sh</code>.
        Dependencies can be enabled for the Windows native GCC compilers by setting
        <code>MKDEPS</code> to point to <code>$(TOPDIR)/tools/mkdeps.sh --winpaths $(TOPDIR)</code>.
      </small></p>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Supported Windows Native Toolchains</b>.
      At present, only the Zilog Z16F, z8Encore, and eZ80Acclaim ports use a non-GCC native Windows
      toolchain(the Zilog ZDS-II toolchain).
      Support for Windows native GCC toolchains (CodeSourcery and devkitARM) is currently implemented
      for the NXP LPC214x, STMicro STR71x, and Luminary LMS6918 ARM ports.
      (but could easily be extended to any other GCC-based platform with a small effort).

    <p>
      <b>Environment Dependencies</b>.
      The primary environmental dependency of NuttX are (1) GNU make,
      (2) bash scripting, and (3) Linux utilities (such as cat, sed, etc.).
      If you have other platforms that support GNU make or make
      utilities that are compatible with GNU make, then it is very
      likely that NuttX would work in that environment as well (with some
      porting effort). If GNU make is not supported, then some significant
      modification of the Make system would be required.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>GNUWin32</b>.
      For example, with suitable make system changes, it should be possible to
      use native GNU tools (such as those from
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/">GNUWin32</a>)
      to build NuttX.
      However, that environment has not been used as of this writing.

nuttx-5.1 2010-01-30 Gregory Nutt &lt;spudmonkey@racsa.co.cr&gt;

	* arch/arm/src/lpc313x and arch/arm/include/lpc313x: Added framework
	  to support the NXP LPC3131 MCU
	* Add configs/ea3131.  The LPC3131 port for the Embedded Artist EA3131
	  (LPC3131) is code complete and waiting for me to get hardware in
	  hand.
	* arch/arm/src/sam3u, arch/arm/include/sam3u, and configs/sam3u-ek -
	  Added the basic framework needed to begin a port for the SAM3U-EK
	  development board.
	* confgs/ea3131/tools: Added a tool to create a image suitable for
	  use with the LPC313x bootloader.
	* configs/sam3u-3k/ostest - Completed verification of the basic NuttX
	  OS test for the SAM3U.
	* arch/arm/src/common/up_createstack - stack was always been cleared
	  when it was allocated.  This is a good feature for monitoring the 
	  stack during debug, but really hurts thread start-up performance.
	  Clearing is now done if CONFIG_DEBUG=y only.  Changes was only made
	  for arm, but really should be made for all architectures.
	* configs/sam3u/nsh - Added NSH configuration for SAM3U

pascal-2.0 2010-12-21 Gregory Nutt &lt;spudmonkey@racsa.co.cr&gt;

	* Updated to use standard C99 types in stdint.h and
	  stdbool.h.  This change was necessary for compatibility
	  with NuttX-5.0 (any beyond).

buildroot-1.8 2009-12-21 &lt;spudmonkey@racsa.co.cr&gt;

	* configs/cortexm3-defconfig-4.3.3: Added support for NuttX NXFLAT
	  tools.
	* configs/arm7tdmi-defconfig-4.3.3: Update to arm7tdmi-defconfig-4.2.4.
	  Also builds NuttX NXFLAT tools.
	* configs/m68hc12-defconfig-4.3.3: Update to m68ch11-defconfig.
	* configs/m68hc12-defconfig-3.4.6: There are problems building GCC
	  4.3.3 for the hc12.
	* configs/m32c-defconfig-4.2.4: Added genromfs
	* configs/m32c-defconfig-4.3.3: Update to m32c-defconfig-4.2.4
