<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  Nuttx is a real timed embedded operating system (RTOS).
  Its goals are:
<p>
<ol>
  <li>A very small footprint usable in all but the tightest micro-controller environments,</li>
  <li>Fully scalable from tiny (8-bit) to moderate embedded (32-bit),</li>
  <li>High degree of standards compliance.</li>
  <li>Totally open.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Supported Platforms</h1>

<ul>
<li><b>x86 Linux Simulation</b>.  Fully functional.</li>
<li>TI <b>TMS320C5471</b> (also called <b>TMS320DM180</b>).
    NuttX operates on the ARM7 of this dual core processor.
    This port uses the <a href="http://www.spectrumdigital.com/">Spectrum Digital</a>
    evaluation board with a GNU arm-elf toolchain*.
    This port is in progress and partially functional (However,
    my board is dead at the moment so it will be awhile before I fix it)</li>
<li><b>8051 Microcontroller</b>.
    This port uses the <a href="http://www.pjrc.com/">PJRC</a> 87C52 development system
    and the <a href="http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/">SDCC</a> toolchain.
    This port will require a few more weeks before it is ready for prime time.</li>
<li><b>Other ports</b>.
    I also have partial ports for the TI TMS320DM270 and for MIPS. 
</ul>

<blockquote>* A highly modified <a href="http://buildroot.uclibc.org/">buildroot</a>
is available that be used to build a NuttX-compatible arm-elf toolchain.</blockquote>

<h1>Memory Footprint</h1>

<p>Details to be provided</p>

<p>
  I have a complete build for an ARM7 target that includes most of the OS
  features and a broad range of OS tests.
  That builds to an executable that requires about 85Kb for .text, .data., and .bss.
</p>
<p>
  I have a stripped down OS test for the 8051 target that requires only
  18Kb.  A substantial effort was required to get to this size
  (see <a href="codesize-070301.xls">spreadsheet</a> for details).
</p>

<h1>Licensing</h1>

<p>NuttX is available under the highly permissive
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_license">BSD license</a>.
  Other than some fine print that you agree to respect my copyright
  you should feel absolutely free to use NuttX in any environment and
