 * Name: opendir
 *
 * Description:
 *   The  opendir() function opens a directory stream
 *   corresponding to the directory name, and returns a
 *   pointer to the directory stream. The stream is
 *   positioned at the first entry in the directory.
 *
 * Inputs:
 *   path -- the directory to open
 *
 * Return:
 *   The opendir() function returns a pointer to the
 *   directory stream.  On error, NULL is returned, and
 *   errno is set appropriately.
 *
 *   EACCES  - Permission denied.
 *   EMFILE  - Too many file descriptors in use by process.
 *   ENFILE  - Too many files are currently open in the
 *             system.
 *   ENOENT  - Directory does not exist, or name is an empty
 *             string.
 *   ENOMEM  - Insufficient memory to complete the operation.
 *   ENOTDIR - 'path' is not a directory.
 *
