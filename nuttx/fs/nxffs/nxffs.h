 *                 |              | inode.
 *               --+--------------+
 *
 * General operation:
 *   Inodes are written starting at the beginning of FLASH.  As inodes are
 *   deleted, they are marked as deleted but not removed.  As new inodes are
 *   written, allocations  proceed to toward the end of the FLASH -- thus,
 *   supporting wear leveling by using all FLASH blocks equally.
 *
 *   When the FLASH becomes full (no more space at the end of the FLASH), a
 *   clean-up operation must be performed:  All inodes marked deleted are
 *   finally removed and the remaining inodes are packed at the beginning of
 *   the FLASH.  Allocations then continue at the freed FLASH memory at the
 *   end of the FLASH.
 *
 * BLOCK HEADER:
 *   The block header is used to determine if the block has every been
 *   formatted and also indicates bad blocks which should never be used.
 *
 * INODE HEADER:
 *   Each inode begins with an inode header that contains, among other things,
 *   the name of the inode, the offset to the first data block, and the
 *   length of the inode data.
 *
 *   At present, the only kind of inode support is a file.  So for now, the
 *   term file and inode are interchangeable.
 *
 * INODE DATA HEADER:
 *   Inode data is enclosed in a data header.  For a given inode, there
 *   is at most one inode data block per logical block.  If the inode data
 *   spans more than one logical block, then the inode data may be enclosed
 *   in multiple data blocks, one per logical block.
 *
 * NXFFS Limitations:
 * 1. Since the files are contiguous in FLASH and since allocations always
 *    proceed toward the end of the FLASH, there can only be one file opened
 *    for writing at a time.  Multiple files may be opened for reading.
 * 2. Files may not be increased in size after they have been closed.  The
 *    O_APPEND open flag is not supported.
 * 3. Files are always written sequential.  Seeking within a file opened for
 *    writing will not work.
 * 4. There are no directories, however, '/' may be used within a file name
 *    string providing some illusion of directories.
 * 5. Files may be opened for reading or for writing, but not both: The O_RDWR
 *    open flag is not supported.
 * 6. The clean-up process occurs only during a write when the free FLASH
 *    memory at the end of the FLASH is exhausted.  Thus, occasionally, file
 *    writing may take a long time.
 * 7. Another limitation is that there can be only a single NXFFS volume
 *    mounted at any time.  This has to do with the fact that we bind to
 *    an MTD driver (instead of a block driver) and bypass all of the normal
 *    mount operations.

 * Description:
 *   Find the next valid (logical) block in the volume.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   volume - Describes the NXFFS volume
 *   block  - On entry, this provides the starting block number.  If the
 *     function is succesfful, then this memory location will hold the
 *     block number of the next valid block on return.

 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   volume - Describes the current NXFFS volume.
 *   stats  - On return, will hold nformation describing the state of the

 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Negated errnos are returned only in the case of MTD reported failures.

 *   name - The name of the inode to check.
 *
 * Returned Value:
