 * Name: rammmap
 *
 * Description:
 *   Support simulation of memory mapped files by copying files into RAM.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   fd      file descriptor of the backing file -- required.
 *   length  The length of the mapping.  For exception #1 above, this length
 *           ignored:  The entire underlying media is always accessible.
 *   offset  The offset into the file to map
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   On success, rammmap() returns a pointer to the mapped area. On error, the
 *   value MAP_FAILED is returned, and errno is set  appropriately.
 *
 *     EBADF
 *      'fd' is not a valid file descriptor.
 *     EINVAL
 *       'length' or 'offset' are invalid
 *     ENOMEM
 *       Insufficient memory is available to map the file.
