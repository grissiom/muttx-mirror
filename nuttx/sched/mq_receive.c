 * Function:  mq_receive
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function receives the oldest of the highest
 *   priority messages from the message queue specified by
 *   "mqdes."  If the size of the buffer in bytes (msglen) is
 *   less than the "mq_msgsize" attribute of the message
 *   queue, mq_receive will return an error.  Otherwise, the
 *   select message is removed from the queue and copied to
 *   "msg."
 *
 *   If the message queue is empty and O_NONBLOCK was not
 *   set, mq_receive() will block until a message is added
 *   to the message queue.  If more than one task is waiting
 *   to receive a message, only the task with the highest
 *   priority that has waited the longest will be unblocked.
 *
 *   If the queue is empty and O_NONBLOCK is set, ERROR will
 *   be returned.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   mqdes - Message Queue Descriptor
 *   msg - Buffer to receive the message
 *   msglen - Size of the buffer in bytes
 *   prio - If not NULL, the location to store message
 *      priority.
 *
 * Return Value:
 *   One success, the length of the selected message in bytes.is
 *   returned.  On failure, -1 (ERROR) is returned and the errno
 *   is set appropriately:
 *
 *   EAGAIN   The queue was empty, and the O_NONBLOCK flag was set
 *            for the message queue description referred to by 'mqdes'.
 *   EPERM    Message queue opened not opened for reading.
 *   EMSGSIZE 'msglen' was less than the maxmsgsize attribute of the
 *            message queue.
 *   EINTR    The call was interrupted by a signal handler.
 *   EINVAL   Invalid 'msg' or 'mqdes'
 *
 * Assumptions:
