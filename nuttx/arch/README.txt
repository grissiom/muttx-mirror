Architecture-Specific Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The file include/nuttx/arch.h identifies all of the APIs that must
be provided by the architecture specific logic.  (It also includes
arch/<arch-name>/arch.h as described below).

Directory Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Thie arch directory contains architecture specific logic.  Each aructure
provide a a subdirectory <arch-name>under arch/ with the folling characteristics:


	<arch-name>
	|-- Make.defs
	|-- defconfig
	|-- setenv.sh
	|-- include
	|   |-- arch.h
	|   |-- irq.h
	|   `-- types.h
	`-- src
	    |-- Makefile
	    `-- (architecture-specific source files)

Summary of Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Make.defs -- This makefile fragment provides architecture and
  tool-specific build options.  It will be included by all other
  makefiles in the build (once it is installed).  This make fragment
  should define:

	Tools: CC, LD, AR, NM, OBJCOPY, OBJDUMP
	Tool options: CFLAGS, LDFLAGS

  When this makefile fragment runs, it will be passed TOPDIR which
  is the path to the root directory of the build.  This makefile
  fragment may include ${TOPDIR}/.config to perform configuration
  specific settings.  For example, the CFLAGS will most likely be
  different if CONFIG_DEBUG=y.

defconfig -- This is a configuration file similar to the Linux
  configuration file.  In contains varialble/value pairs like:

	CONFIG_VARIABLE=value

  This configuration file will be used at build time:

    (1) as a makefile fragment included in other makefiles, and
    (2) to generate include/nuttx/config.h which is included by
        most C files in the system.

  The following variables are recognized by the build (you may
  also include architecture-specific settings).

	Architecture selection:

		CONFIG_ARCH - identifies the arch subdirectory
		CONFIG_ARCH_name - for use in C code

	General OS setup

		CONFIG_EXAMPLE - identifies the subdirectgory in examples
		  that will be used in the build
		CONFIG_DEBUG - enables built-in debug options
		CONFIG_DEBUG_VERBOSE - enables verbose debug output
		CONFIG_HAVE_LOWPUTC - architecture supports low-level, boot
		  time console output
		CONFIG_RR_INTERVAL - The round robin timeslice will be set
		  this number of milliseconds;  Round robin scheduling can
		  be disabled by setting this value to zero.
		CONFIG_SCHED_INSTRUMENTATION - enables instrumentation in 
		  scheduler to monitor system performance
		CONFIG_TASK_NAME_SIZE - Spcifies that maximum size of a
		  task name to save in the TCB.  Useful if scheduler
		  instrumentation is selected.  Set to zero to disable.
		CONFIG_START_YEAR, CONFIG_START_MONTH, CONFIG_START_DAY -
		  Used to initialize the internal time logic.
		CONFIG_JULIAN_TIME - Enables Julian time conversions
		CONFIG_DEV_CONSOLE - Set if architecture-specific logic
		  provides /dev/console.  Enables stdout, stderr, stdin.

	Allow for artchitecture optimized implementations

		The architecture can provide optimized versions of the
		following to improve sysem performance

		CONFIG_ARCH_MEMCPY, CONFIG_ARCH_MEMCMP, CONFIG_ARCH_MEMMOVE
		CONFIG_ARCH_MEMSET, CONFIG_ARCH_STRCMP, CONFIG_ARCH_STRCPY
		CONFIG_ARCH_STRNCPY, CONFIG_ARCH_STRLEN, CONFIG_ARCH_BZERO
		CONFIG_ARCH_KMALLOC, CONFIG_ARCH_KZMALLOC, CONFIG_ARCH_KFREE

	General Compile environment setup

		CONFIG_HAVE_LONG_LONG - enable if your architecture supports
		  long long types and if you plan to use them

	Sizes of configurable things (0 disables)

		CONFIG_NPTHREAD_KEYS - The number of items of thread-
		  specific data that can be retained
		CONFIG_NFILE_DESCRIPTORS - The maximum number of file
		  descriptors (one for each open)
		CONFIG_NFILE_STREAMS - The maximum number of streams that
		  can be fopen'ed
		CONFIG_STDIO_BUFFER_SIZE - Size of the buffer to allocate
		  on fopen. (Only if CONFIG_NFILE_STREAMS > 0)
		CONFIG_NUNGET_CHARS - Number of characters that can be
		  buffered by ungetc() (Only if CONFIG_NFILE_STREAMS > 0)
		CONFIG_PREALLOC_MQ_MSGS - The number of pre-allocated message
		  structures.  The system manages a pool of preallocated
		  message structures to minimize dynamic allocations
		CONFIG_MQ_MAXMSGSIZE - Message structures are allocated with
		  a fixed payload size given by this settin (does not include
		  other message structure overhead.
		CONFIG_PREALLOC_WDOGS - The number of pre-allocated watchdog
		  structures.  The system manages a pool of preallocated
		  watchdog structures to minimize dynamic allocations

	Stack and heap information

		CONFIG_BOOT_FROM_FLASH - Some configurations support XIP
		  operation from FLASH.
		CONFIG_STACK_POINTER - The initial stack pointer
		CONFIG_PROC_STACK_SIZE - The size of the initial stack
		CONFIG_PTHREAD_STACK_MIN - Minimum pthread stack size
		CONFIG_PTHREAD_STACK_DEFAULT - Default pthread stack size
		CONFIG_HEAP_BASE - The beginning of the heap
		CONFIG_HEAP_SIZE - The size of the heap

setenv.sh -- This is a script that you can include that will be installed at
  the toplevel of the directory structure and can be sourced to set any
  necessary environment variables.

include/arch.h
  This is a hook for any architecture specific definitions that may
  be needed by the system.  It is included by include/nuttx/arch.h

include/types.h
  This provides architecture/toolchain-specific definitions for
  standard types.  This file should typedef:

  sbyte, ubyte, uint8, boolean, sint16, uint16, sint32, uint32, sint64, uint64

  This file will be included by include/sys/types.h and be made
  available to all files.

include/irq.h
  This file needs to define some architecture specific functions (usually
  inline) and structure.  These include:

  - struct xcptcontext.  This structures represents the saved context
    of a thread.

  - static inline uint32 irqsave(void) -- Used to disable
    all interrupts.

  - static inline void irqrestore(uint32 flags) -- Used to
    restore interrupts enables to the same state as before irqsave
    was called.

  This file must also define NR_IRQS, the total number of IRQs supported
  by the board.

src/Makefile
  This makefile will be executed to build the targets src/libup.a and
  src/up_head.o.  The up_head.o file holds the entry point into the system
  (power-on reset entry point, for example).  It will be used in
  the final link with libup.a and other system archives to generate the
  final executable.

Configuring NuttX
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Configuring NuttX requires only copying

  arch/<arch-name>/Make.def to ${TOPDIR}/Make.defs
  arch/<arch-name>/setenv.sh to ${TOPDIR}/setenv.sh
  arch/<arch-name>/defconfig to ${TOPDIR}/.config

There is a script that automates these steps.  The following steps will
accomplish the same configuration:

  cd tools
  ./configure.sh <arch-name>
