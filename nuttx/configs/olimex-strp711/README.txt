Development Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Either Linux or Cygwin on Windows can be used for the development environment.
  The source has been built only using the GNU toolchain (see below).  Other
  toolchains will likely cause problems.

GNU Toolchain Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  The NuttX make system has been modified to support the following different
  toolchain options.

  1. The NuttX buildroot Toolchain (see below).
  2. The CodeSourcery GNU toolchain,
  3. The devkitARM GNU toolchain, or

  All testing has been conducted using the NuttX buildroot toolchain.  To use
  the CodeSourcery or devkitARM GNU toolchain, you simply need to build the
  system as follows:

     make                         # Will build for the NuttX buildroot toolchain
     make CROSSDEV=arm-eabi-      # Will build for the devkitARM toolchain
     make CROSSDEV=arm-none-eabi- # Will build for the CodeSourcery toolchain
     make CROSSDEV=arm-elf-       # Will build for the NuttX buildroot toolchain

  Of course, hard coding this CROSS_COMPILE value in Make.defs file will save
  some repetitive typing.

  NOTE: the CodeSourcery and devkitARM toolchains are Windows native toolchains.
  The NuttX buildroot toolchain is a Cygwin toolchain.  There are several limitations
  to using a Windows based toolchain in a Cygwin environment.  The three biggest are:

  1. The Windows toolchain cannot follow Cygwin paths.  Path conversions are
     performed automatically in the Cygwin makefiles using the 'cygpath' utility
     but you might easily find some new path problems.  If so, check out 'cygpath -w'

  2. Windows toolchains cannot follow Cygwin symbolic links.  Many symbolic links
     are used in Nuttx (e.g., include/arch).  The make system works around these
     problems for the Windows tools by copying directories instead of linking them.
     But this can also cause some confusion for you:  For example, you may edit
     a file in a "linked" directory and find that your changes had not effect.
     That is because you are building the copy of the file in the "fake" symbolic
     directory.  If you use a Windows toolchain, you should get in the habit of
     making like this:

       make clean_context; make CROSSDEV=arm-none-eabi-

     An alias in your .bashrc file might make that less painful.

  3. Dependencies are not made when using Windows versions of the GCC.  This is
     because the dependencies are generated using Windows pathes which do not
     work with the Cygwin make.

     Support has been added for making dependencies with the CodeSourcery toolchain.
     That support can be enabled by modifying your Make.defs file as follows:

    -  MKDEP                = $(TOPDIR)/tools/mknulldeps.sh
    +  MKDEP                = $(TOPDIR)/tools/mkdeps.sh --winpaths "$(TOPDIR)"

     If you have problems with the dependency build (for example, if you are not
     building on C:), then you may need to modify tools/mkdeps.sh

  NOTE 1: The CodeSourcery toolchain (2009q1) may not work with default optimization
  level of -Os (See Make.defs).  It will work with -O0, -O1, or -O2, but not with
  -Os.

  NOTE 2: The devkitARM toolchain includes a version of MSYS make.  Make sure that
  the paths to Cygwin's /bin and /usr/bin directories appear BEFORE the devkitARM
  path or will get the wrong version of make.

NuttX buildroot Toolchain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  A GNU GCC-based toolchain is assumed.  The files */setenv.sh should
  be modified to point to the correct path to the ARM toolchain (if
  different from the default).

  If you have no ARM toolchain, one can be downloaded from the NuttX
  SourceForge download site (https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=189573).

  1. You must have already configured Nuttx in <some-dir>nuttx.

     cd tools
     ./configure.sh olimex-strp711/<sub-dir>

  2. Download the latest buildroot package into <some-dir>

  3. unpack

  4. cd <some-dir>/buildroot

  5. cp configs/arm-defconfig .config
     or
     cp configs/arm7tdmi-defconfig-4.3.3 .config  (Last tested with this toolchain)

  6. make oldconfig

  7. make

  8. Edit setenv.h so that the PATH variable includes the path to the
     newly built binaries.

OpenOCD
^^^^^^^

For a debug environment, I am using OpenOCD with a Wiggler-clone JTAG interface.  The
following steps worked for me with a 20081028 OpenOCD snapshot.

GENERAL STEPS:

1. Check out OpenOCD

    svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/openocd/trunk openocd

2. Build OpenOCD

  Read the INSTALL file from the files you just downloaded.  You probably just need
  to run:

    ./bootstrap

  Then configure OpenOCD using the configure script created by ./bootstrap.

    ./configure --enable-parport

  Build OpenOCD with:

    make

  Install OpenOCD.  Since we used the default configuration the code will be
  installed at /usr/local/bin/openocd. Other files will be installed at
  /usr/local/lib/openocd (configuration files, scripts, etc.) and /usr/local/share/info
  (online documentation accessable via 'info openocd').  You need root priviledges
  to do the following:

    make install.

3. Setup

  OpenOCD reads its configuration from the file openocd.cfg in the current directory
  when started.  You have two different options:

  * Create a symbolic link named openocd.cfg to one of the configuration files in
    /usr/local/lib/openocd, or

  * Use a custom configuration file specified with the ‘-f <conf.file>’ command line
    switch opeion when starting OpenOCD.

  For the STR-P711, I have included bash scripts in the scripts sub-directory.

4. Running OpenOCD

  Make sure the ARM7TDMI board is powered and the JTAG cable is connected

  Run 'src/openocd -d' (might be required to be root) and check for any errors
  reported. The '-d' option enables debugging info.

5. Telnet interface

  telnet into port 4444 to get a command interface: 'telnet localhost 4444'

6. GDB

  start arm-elf-gdb
  type 'file <executable.elf>' to load the executable
  type 'set debug remote 1' to enable tracing of gdb protocol (if required)
  type 'target remote localhost:3333' to connect to the target
  The same commands from the telnet interface can now be accessed through the
  'monitor' command, e.g. 'monitor help'

Configurations:
---------------

  nsh:
    Configures the NuttShell (nsh) located at examples/nsh.  The
    Configuration enables both the serial and telnetd NSH interfaces.

  ostest:
    This configuration directory, performs a simple OS test using
    examples/ostest.
