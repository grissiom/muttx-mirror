shterm
^^^^^^

  The USB7032EVB1 supports CMON in PROM.  CMON requires special
  serial interactions in order to upload and download program files.
  Therefore, a standard terminal emulation program (such as minicom)
  cannot be used.

  The shterm subdirectory contains a small terminal emulation
  program that supports these special interactions for file transfers.
