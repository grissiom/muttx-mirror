Board-Specific Configurations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The NuttX configuration consists of:

o Processor architecture specific files.  These are the files contained
  in the arch/<arch-name>/ directory.

o Chip/SoC specific files.  Each processor processor architecture
  is embedded in chip or System-on-a-Chip (SoC) architecture.  The
  full chip architecture includes the processor architecture plus
  chip-specific interrupt logic, general purpose I/O (GIO) logic, and
  specialized, internal peripherals (such as UARTs, USB, etc.).

  These chip-specific files are contained within chip-specific
  sub-directories in the arch/<arch-name>/ directory and are selected
  via the CONFIG_ARCH_name selection

o Board specific files.  In order to be usable, the chip must be
  contained in a board environment.  The board configuration defines
  additional properties of the board including such things as
  peripheral LEDs, external peripherals (such as network, USB, etc.).

  These board-specific configuration files can be found in the
  configs/<board-name>/ sub-directories and are discussed in this
  README.  Additional configuration information maybe available in
  board-specific configs/<board-name>/README.txt files.

The configs/ subdirectory contains configuration data for each board.  These
board-specific configurations plus the architecture-specific configurations in
the arch/ subdirectory completely define a customized port of NuttX.

Directory Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The configs directory contains board specific configurationlogic.  Each
board must provide a subdirectory <board-name> under configs/ with the
following characteristics:


	<board-name>
	|-- include/
	|   `-- (board-specific header files)
	|-- src/
	|   |-- Makefile
	|   `-- (board-specific source files)
        |-- <config1-dir>
	|   |-- Make.defs
	|   |-- defconfig
	|   `-- setenv.sh
        |-- <config2-dir>
	|   |-- Make.defs
	|   |-- defconfig
	|   `-- setenv.sh
	...
Summary of Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

include/ -- This directory contains board specific header files.  This
  directory will be linked as include/arch/board at configuration time and
  can be included via '#include <arch/board/header.h>'.  These header file
  can only be included by files in arch/<arch-name>include/ and
  arch/<arch-name>/src

src/ -- This directory contains board specific drivers.  This
  directory will be linked as arch/<arch-name>/src/board at configuration
  time and will be integrated into the build system.

src/Makefile -- This makefile will be invoked to build the board specific
  drivers.  It must support the following targets:  libext$(LIBEXT), clean,
  and distclean.

A board may have various different configurations using these common source
files.  Each board configuration is described by three files:  Make.defs,
defconfig, and setenv.sh.  Typically, each set of configuration files is
retained in a separate configuration sub-directory (<config1-dir>,
<config2-dir>, .. in the above diagram).

Make.defs -- This makefile fragment provides architecture and
  tool-specific build options.  It will be included by all other
  makefiles in the build (once it is installed).  This make fragment
  should define:

	Tools: CC, LD, AR, NM, OBJCOPY, OBJDUMP
	Tool options: CFLAGS, LDFLAGS
	COMPILE, ASSEMBLE, ARCHIVE, CLEAN, and MKDEP macros

  When this makefile fragment runs, it will be passed TOPDIR which
  is the path to the root directory of the build.  This makefile
  fragment may include ${TOPDIR}/.config to perform configuration
  specific settings.  For example, the CFLAGS will most likely be
  different if CONFIG_DEBUG=y.

defconfig -- This is a configuration file similar to the Linux
  configuration file.  In contains variable/value pairs like:

	CONFIG_VARIABLE=value

  This configuration file will be used at build time:

    (1) as a makefile fragment included in other makefiles, and
    (2) to generate include/nuttx/config.h which is included by
        most C files in the system.

  The following variables are recognized by the build (you may
  also include architecture/board-specific settings).

	Architecture selection:

		CONFIG_ARCH - Identifies the arch/ subdirectory
		CONFIG_ARCH_name - For use in C code
		CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP - Identifies the arch/*/chip subdirectory
		CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP_name - For use in C code
		CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD - Identifies the configs subdirectory and
		   hence, the board that supports the particular chip or SoC.
		CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD_name - For use in C code
                CONFIG_ENDIAN_BIG - define if big endian (default is little
                   endian)

	Some architectures require a description of the the RAM configuration:

		CONFIG_DRAM_SIZE - Describes the installed DRAM.
		CONFIG_DRAM_START - The start address of DRAM (physical)
		CONFIG_DRAM_VSTART - The startaddress of DRAM (virtual)


	General build options

		CONFIG_RRLOAD_BINARY - make the rrload binary format used with
		  BSPs from www.ridgerun.com
		CONFIG_HAVE_LIBM - toolchain supports libm.a

	General OS setup

		CONFIG_EXAMPLE - identifies the subdirectory in examples
		  that will be used in the build
		CONFIG_DEBUG - enables built-in debug options
		CONFIG_DEBUG_VERBOSE - enables verbose debug output
		CONFIG_DEBUG_SCHED - enable OS debug output (disabled by
		  default)
		CONFIG_DEBUG_MM - enable memory management debug output
		  (disabled by default)
		CONFIG_DEBUG_NET - enable network debug output (disabled
		  by default)
		CONFIG_DEBUG_FS - enable filesystem debug output (disabled
		  by default)
		CONFIG_DEBUG_LIB - enable C library debug output (disabled
		  by default)
		CONFIG_HAVE_LOWPUTC - architecture supports low-level, boot
		  time console output
		CONFIG_MM_REGIONS - If the architecture includes multiple
		  regions of memory to allocate from, this specifies the
		  number of memory regions that the memory manager must
		  handle and enables the API mm_addregion(start, end);
		CONFIG_TICKS_PER_MSEC - The default system timer is 100Hz
		  or TICKS_PER_MSEC=10.  This setting may be defined to
		  inform NuttX that the processor hardware is providing
		  system timer interrupts at some interrupt interval other
		  than 10 msec.
		CONFIG_RR_INTERVAL - The round robin timeslice will be set
		  this number of milliseconds;  Round robin scheduling can
		  be disabled by setting this value to zero.
		CONFIG_SCHED_INSTRUMENTATION - enables instrumentation in 
		  scheduler to monitor system performance
		CONFIG_TASK_NAME_SIZE - Specifies that maximum size of a
		  task name to save in the TCB.  Useful if scheduler
		  instrumentation is selected.  Set to zero to disable.
		CONFIG_START_YEAR, CONFIG_START_MONTH, CONFIG_START_DAY -
		  Used to initialize the internal time logic.
		CONFIG_JULIAN_TIME - Enables Julian time conversions
		CONFIG_DEV_CONSOLE - Set if architecture-specific logic
		  provides /dev/console.  Enables stdout, stderr, stdin.

	The following can be used to disable categories of APIs supported
	by the OS.  If the compiler supports weak functions, then it
	should not be necessary to disable functions unless you want to
	restrict usage of those APIs.

	There are certain dependency relationships in these features.

	o mq_notify logic depends on signals to awaken tasks
	  waiting for queues to become full or empty.
	o pthread_condtimedwait() depends on signals to wake
	  up waiting tasks.

		CONFIG_DISABLE_CLOCK, CONFIG_DISABLE_POSIX_TIMERS, CONFIG_DISABLE_PTHREAD.
		CONFIG_DISABLE_SIGNALS, CONFIG_DISABLE_MQUEUE, CONFIG_DISABLE_MOUNTPOUNT,
		CONFIG_DISABLE_ENVIRON


	Misc libc settings

		CONFIG_NOPRINTF_FIELDWIDTH - sprintf-related logic is a
		   little smaller if we do not support fieldwidthes

	Allow for architecture optimized implementations

		The architecture can provide optimized versions of the
		following to improve system performance

		CONFIG_ARCH_MEMCPY, CONFIG_ARCH_MEMCMP, CONFIG_ARCH_MEMMOVE
		CONFIG_ARCH_MEMSET, CONFIG_ARCH_STRCMP, CONFIG_ARCH_STRCPY
		CONFIG_ARCH_STRNCPY, CONFIG_ARCH_STRLEN, CONFIG_ARCH_BZERO
		CONFIG_ARCH_KMALLOC, CONFIG_ARCH_KZMALLOC, CONFIG_ARCH_KFREE

Supported Boards
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

configs/sim
    A user-mode port of NuttX to the x86 Linux platform is available.
    The purpose of this port is primarily to support OS feature development.
    This port does not support interrupts or a real timer (and hence no
    round robin scheduler)  Otherwise, it is complete.

    NOTE: This target will not run on Cygwin probably for many reasons but
    first off because it uses some of the same symbols as does cygwin.dll.

configs/c5471evm
    This is a port to the Spectrum Digital C5471 evaluation board.  The
    TMS320C5471 is a dual core processor from TI with an ARM7TDMI general
    purpose processor and a c54 DSP.  It is also known as TMS320DA180 or just DA180. 
    NuttX runs on the ARM core and is built with with a GNU arm-elf toolchain*.
    This port is complete, verified, and included in the NuttX release.

configs/mcu123-lpc214x
    This is a port to the mcu123.com lpc214x development board.
    This OS is also built with the the arm-elf toolchain*

configs/ntosd-dm320
    This port uses the Neuros OSD with a GNU arm-elf toolchain*:
    see http://wiki.neurostechnology.com/index.php/Developer_Welcome .
    NuttX operates on the ARM9EJS of this dual core processor.
    STATUS: This port is code complete, verified, and included in the
    NuttX 0.2.1 release.

configs/mcu123-lpc214x
    This port is for the NXP LPC2148 as provided on the mcu123.com
    lpc214x development board.
    STATUS: This port is in progress and should be available in the
    nuttx-0.2.5 release.

configs/m68322evb
    This is a work in progress for the venerable m68322evb board from
    Motorola. This OS is also built with the the arm-elf toolchain*.

configs/pjrc-8051
    8051 Microcontroller.  This port uses the PJRC 87C52 development system
    and the SDCC toolchain.   This port is not quite ready for prime time.

configs/z16f2800100zcog
    z16f Microncontroller.  This port use the Zilog z16f2800100zcog
    development kit and the Zilog ZDS-II Windows command line tools.  The
    development environment is Cygwin under WinXP.

configs/z80zim
    z80 Microcontroller.  This port uses a Z80 instruction set simulator.
    That simulator can be found in the NuttX CVS at
    http://nuttx.cvs.sourceforge.net/nuttx/misc/sims/z80sim.
    This port also the SDCC toolchain (http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/")
    (verified with version 2.6.0).

Other ports for the for the TI TMS320DM270, M683222 and for MIPS are in various
states of progress

Configuring NuttX
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Configuring NuttX requires only copying

  configs/<board-name>/<config-dir>/Make.def to ${TOPDIR}/Make.defs
  configs/<board-name>/<config-dir>/setenv.sh to ${TOPDIR}/setenv.sh
  configs/<board-name>/<config-dir>/defconfig to ${TOPDIR}/.config

tools/configure.sh
  There is a script that automates these steps.  The following steps will
  accomplish the same configuration:

  cd tools
  ./configure.sh <board-name>/<config-dir>
