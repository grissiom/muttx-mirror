Development Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Either Linux or Cygwin on Windows can be used for the development environment.
  The source has been built only using the GNU toolchain (see below).  Other
  toolchains will likely cause problems. Testing was performed using the Cygwin
  environment.

GNU Toolchain Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  The NuttX make system has been modified to support the following different
  toolchain options.

  1. The CodeSourcery GNU toolchain,
  2. The devkitARM GNU toolchain,
  3. The NuttX buildroot Toolchain (see below).

  All testing has been conducted using the NuttX buildroot toolchain.  However,
  the make system is setup to default to use the devkitARM toolchain.  To use
  the CodeSourcery or devkitARM toolchain, you simply need add one of the
  following configuration options to your .config (or defconfig) file:

    CONFIG_LPC17_CODESOURCERYW=y   : CodeSourcery under Windows
    CONFIG_LPC17_CODESOURCERYL=y   : CodeSourcery under Linux
    CONFIG_LPC17_DEVKITARM=y       : devkitARM under Windows
    CONFIG_LPC17_BUILDROOT=y       : NuttX buildroot under Linux or Cygwin (default)

  If you are not using CONFIG_LPC17_BUILDROOT, then you may also have to modify
  the PATH in the setenv.h file if your make cannot find the tools.

  NOTE: the CodeSourcery (for Windows)and devkitARM are Windows native toolchains.
  The CodeSourcey (for Linux) and NuttX buildroot toolchains are Cygwin and/or
  Linux native toolchains. There are several limitations to using a Windows based
  toolchain in a Cygwin environment.  The three biggest are:

  1. The Windows toolchain cannot follow Cygwin paths.  Path conversions are
     performed automatically in the Cygwin makefiles using the 'cygpath' utility
     but you might easily find some new path problems.  If so, check out 'cygpath -w'

  2. Windows toolchains cannot follow Cygwin symbolic links.  Many symbolic links
     are used in Nuttx (e.g., include/arch).  The make system works around these
     problems for the Windows tools by copying directories instead of linking them.
     But this can also cause some confusion for you:  For example, you may edit
     a file in a "linked" directory and find that your changes had not effect.
     That is because you are building the copy of the file in the "fake" symbolic
     directory.  If you use a Windows toolchain, you should get in the habit of
     making like this:

       make clean_context all

     An alias in your .bashrc file might make that less painful.

  3. Dependencies are not made when using Windows versions of the GCC.  This is
     because the dependencies are generated using Windows pathes which do not
     work with the Cygwin make.

     Support has been added for making dependencies with the windows-native toolchains.
     That support can be enabled by modifying your Make.defs file as follows:

    -  MKDEP                = $(TOPDIR)/tools/mknulldeps.sh
    +  MKDEP                = $(TOPDIR)/tools/mkdeps.sh --winpaths "$(TOPDIR)"

     If you have problems with the dependency build (for example, if you are not
     building on C:), then you may need to modify tools/mkdeps.sh

  NOTE 1: The CodeSourcery toolchain (2009q1) does not work with default optimization
  level of -Os (See Make.defs).  It will work with -O0, -O1, or -O2, but not with
  -Os.

  NOTE 2: The devkitARM toolchain includes a version of MSYS make.  Make sure that
  the paths to Cygwin's /bin and /usr/bin directories appear BEFORE the devkitARM
  path or will get the wrong version of make.

IDEs
^^^^

  NuttX is built using command-line make.  It can be used with an IDE, but some
  effort will be required to create the project (There is a simple RIDE project
  in the RIDE subdirectory).
  
  Makefile Build
  --------------
  Under Eclipse, it is pretty easy to set up an "empty makefile project" and
  simply use the NuttX makefile to build the system.  That is almost for free
  under Linux.  Under Windows, you will need to set up the "Cygwin GCC" empty
  makefile project in order to work with Windows (Google for "Eclipse Cygwin" -
  there is a lot of help on the internet).

  Native Build
  ------------
  Here are a few tips before you start that effort:

  1) Select the toolchain that you will be using in your .config file
  2) Start the NuttX build at least one time from the Cygwin command line
     before trying to create your project.  This is necessary to create
     certain auto-generated files and directories that will be needed.
  3) Set up include pathes:  You will need include/, arch/arm/src/lpc17xx,
     arch/arm/src/common, arch/arm/src/cortexm3, and sched/.
  4) All assembly files need to have the definition option -D __ASSEMBLY__
     on the command line.

  Startup files will probably cause you some headaches.  The NuttX startup file
  is arch/arm/src/lpc17x/lpc17_vectors.S.

NuttX buildroot Toolchain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  A GNU GCC-based toolchain is assumed.  The files */setenv.sh should
  be modified to point to the correct path to the Cortex-M3 GCC toolchain (if
  different from the default in your PATH variable).

  If you have no Cortex-M3 toolchain, one can be downloaded from the NuttX
  SourceForge download site (https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=189573).
  This GNU toolchain builds and executes in the Linux or Cygwin environment.

  1. You must have already configured Nuttx in <some-dir>/nuttx.

     cd tools
     ./configure.sh olimex-lpc1766stk/<sub-dir>

  2. Download the latest buildroot package into <some-dir>

  3. unpack the buildroot tarball.  The resulting directory may
     have versioning information on it like buildroot-x.y.z.  If so,
     rename <some-dir>/buildroot-x.y.z to <some-dir>/buildroot.

  4. cd <some-dir>/buildroot

  5. cp configs/cortexm3-defconfig-4.3.3 .config

  6. make oldconfig

  7. make

  8. Edit setenv.h, if necessary, so that the PATH variable includes
     the path to the newly built binaries.

  See the file configs/README.txt in the buildroot source tree.  That has more
  detailed PLUS some special instructions that you will need to follow if you
  are building a Cortex-M3 toolchain for Cygwin under Windows.

  NOTE: This is an OABI toolchain.

LEDs
^^^^

  If CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is defined, then support for the LPC1766-STK LEDs will be
  included in the build.  See:

  - configs/olimex-lpc1766stk/include/board.h - Defines LED constants, types and
    prototypes the LED interface functions.

  - configs/olimex-lpc1766stk/src/lpc1766stk_internal.h - GPIO settings for the LEDs.

  - configs/olimex-lpc1766stk/src/up_leds.c - LED control logic.

  The LPC1766-STK has two LEDs.  If CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is defined, these LEDs will
  be controlled as follows for NuttX debug functionality (where NC means "No Change").
  Basically,

  LED1:
  - OFF means that the OS is still initializing. Initialization is very fast so
    if you see this at all, it probably means that the system is hanging up
    somewhere in the initialization phases.
  - ON means that the OS completed initialization.

  LED2:
  - ON/OFF toggles means that various events are happening.
  - GLowing: LED2 is turned on and off on every interrupt so even timer interrupts
    should cause LED2 to glow faintly in the normal case.
  - Flashing. If the LED2 is flashing at about 1Hz, that means that a crash
    has occurred.  If CONFIG_ARCH_STACKDUMP=y, you will get some diagnostic
    information on the console to help debug what happened.
    Will 

  LED1  LED2      Meaning
  ----- --------  --------------------------------------------------------------------
   OFF   OFF      Still initializing and there is no interrupt activity. 
                  Initialization is very fast so if you see this, it probably means
                  that the system is hung up somewhere in the initialization phases.
   OFF   Glowing  Still initializing (see above) but taking interrupts.
   OFF   ON       This would mean that (1) initialization did not complete but the
                  software is hung, perhaps in an infinite loop, somewhere inside
                  of an interrupt handler.
   OFF   Flashing Ooops!  We crashed before finishing initialization.
 
   ON    OFF      The system has completed initialization, but is apparently not taking
                  any interrupts.
   ON    Glowing  This is the normal healthy state: The OS successfully initialized
                  and is taking interrupts.
   ON    ON       This would mean that (1) the OS complete initialization, but (2)
                  the software is hung, perhaps in an infinite loop, somewhere inside
                  of a signal or interrupt handler.
   ON    Flashing Ooops!  We crashed sometime after initialization.

Olimex LPC1766-STK Configuration Options

	   chip:

	   CONFIG_ARCH_CHIP_LPC1766=y

	CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD - Identifies the configs subdirectory and
	   hence, the board that supports the particular chip or SoC.

	   CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD=olimex-lpc1766stk (for the Olimex LPC1766-STK)

	CONFIG_ARCH_BOARD_name - For use in C code

	   endian)

	CONFIG_DRAM_SIZE - Describes the installed DRAM (CPU SRAM in this case):

	   CONFIG_DRAM_SIZE=(32*1024) (32Kb)

	   There is an additional 32Kb of SRAM in AHB SRAM banks 0 and 1.

	CONFIG_DRAM_START - The start address of installed DRAM

	   CONFIG_DRAM_START=0x10000000

	CONFIG_DRAM_END - Last address+1 of installed RAM

	   CONFIG_DRAM_END=(CONFIG_DRAM_START+CONFIG_DRAM_SIZE)

	CONFIG_ARCH_IRQPRIO - The LPC17xx supports interrupt prioritization

	   CONFIG_ARCH_IRQPRIO=y

	CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS - Use LEDs to show state. Unique to boards that
	   have LEDs

	CONFIG_ARCH_INTERRUPTSTACK - This architecture supports an interrupt
