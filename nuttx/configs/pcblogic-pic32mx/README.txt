configs/pic32mx README
=====================

This README file discusses the port of NuttX to the PIC32MX board from
PCB Logic Design Co.  This board features the MicroChip PIC32MX460F512L.
The board is a very simple -- little more than a carrier for the PIC32
MCU plus voltage regulation, debug interface, and an OTG connector.
