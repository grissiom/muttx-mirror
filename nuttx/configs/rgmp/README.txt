RGMP README File
================

RGMP stands for RTOS and GPOS on Multi-Processor.  RGMP is a project for 
running GPOS and RTOS simultaneously on multi-processor platforms. You can
port your favorite RTOS to RGMP together with an unmodified Linux to form a
hybrid operating system. This makes your application able to use both RTOS
and GPOS feathures.
