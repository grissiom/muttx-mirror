uIP
^^^

Many lower-level networking components of NuttX derive from uIP which
has a similar BSD style license:

   Copyright (c) 2001-2003, Adam Dunkels.
   All rights reserved.

IGMP
^^^^

IGMP support, if enabled in uIP, adds additional logic by Steve Reynolds:

Certain functions in the NuttX C-library derive from other BSD-compatible
sources:

strtod():

dtoa():
^^^^^^

  If you enable floating point conversions with CONFIG_LIBC_FLOATINGPOINT,
  then some files with an unmodified BSD license will be included.  That
  license is similar to the above (modified) BSD license, but has an
  additional requirement that I state the following:

  "This product includes software developed by the University of
   California, Berkeley and its contributors."
