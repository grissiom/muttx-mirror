If you enable floating point conversions with CONFIG_LIBC_FLOATINGPOINT,
then some files with an unmodified BSD license will be included.  That
license is similar to the above (modified) BSD license, but has an
additional requirement that I state the following:

  "This product includes software developed by the University of
   California, Berkeley and its contributors."
