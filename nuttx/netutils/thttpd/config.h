 *    The prefix could be something like "users", or it could be empty.
 * 2) Map ~username to <user's homedir>/<postfix>. The postfix would be the name of
 *    a subdirectory off of the user's actual home dir, something like "public_html".
 *
 * You can also leave both options undefined, and thttpd will not do anything special
 * about tildes. Enabling both options is an error.
